# NextJS Template App

Run `yarn templatize`

## TODO

-   Dockerize the application and deploy dockered version. This includes figuring out how to run pm2 docker containers. [This article](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/docker-pm2-nodejs/) might help.
-   Add list /etc/nginx/sites-enabled automatic profile with domain etc.
-   Add scp to cyberman and delete .sh file after finish
-   Add yarn remove and add after script
